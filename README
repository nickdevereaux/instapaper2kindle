A hack to get around the fact that Instapaper doesn't seem to send out updates to kindles via the scheduler. 
At least from what I've found. Sending to a free.kindle.com account if that helps. 

All this script does is simulate the action of logging in and hitting the send button. Perfect for crontab :)

Copy settings.example.cfg to settings.cfg and change to your username and password. Password is optional (in line with Instapaper's website)

Open crontab with 'crontab -e' and enter the following to receive an update every Friday at 5pm.
